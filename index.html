          <h1>america - a horse with no name</h1>
          <p>
            On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life<br>
            There were plants and birds and rocks and things<br>
            There was sand and hills and rings<br>
            The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz<br>
            And the sky with no clouds<br>
            The heat was hot and the ground was dry<br>
            But the air was full of sound<br>
